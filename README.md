This is the beginnings of a "Dark Theme" for the (Telegram Web App)[http://web.telegram.org]

I use (Stylish)[https://userstyles.org/] to apply this theme in Firefox.

Not too concerned with the structure of this CSS file until I finish tweaking all the different edge cases to my liking (e.g. hover states, select states, special message types)
