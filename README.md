This is the beginnings of a "Dark Theme" for the [Telegram Web App][0]

I use [Stylish][1] to apply this theme in Firefox.

Not too concerned with the structure of this CSS file until I finish tweaking all the different edge cases to my liking (e.g. hover states, select states, special message types)

### Image Diff

Or you can just look at the screenshot of the dark theme:
